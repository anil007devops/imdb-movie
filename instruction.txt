Hi,
I have created frontend in angular8.
To run the application, please follow the instructions:
1. Install Nodejs (https://nodejs.org)
2. Install Angular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)
3. cd project directory
4. Install dependencies (npm install)
5. Start application (npm start) 
6. Opens  browser as address(http://localhost:4200)

Because of cors request origin issue, I have created proxy.config.json file. 
(ng serve --proxy-config ./src/proxy.config.json)
